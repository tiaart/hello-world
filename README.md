# hello-world
This is my first GitHub repository, the traditional Hello World.

My name is Tyler, I'm about to start down the pathway to a career in software engineering. I live in the San Jose Bay Area, and hope to find a job in game development when I graduate from (hopefully) UC Berkeley in four years. Right now, I'm trying not to get too bogged down in dealing with loans and other such worries, and trying to focus on becoming the best programmer I can.
